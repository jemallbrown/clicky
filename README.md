Avengers Clicky Game ReadMe

Welcome to the avengers clicky game – my first React App.

App function;

This is a simple memory game.  The user will need to click on each character no more once during each game play. After clicking an image, all images will shift and reorder.  This makes what seems like a simple game, very complicated. Even with familiar characters, you will make mistakes. The app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.
The game ends when the user clicks on an image more than once.

Why this project?

This project was extremely challenging as it required knowledge of React components and States.  I learned how to manipulate props and create my first truly interactive UI.


Tools Used;

React
Jquery
Javascript
Bootstrap CSS
CSS
HTML
